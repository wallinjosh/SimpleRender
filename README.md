# SimpleRender

My primary focus on this project is to reaquaint myself with Java, while also learning more about the basics of graphics rendering and linear algebra. Though the original implementation of this work was in C++ (repo linked below), I have elected to work in Java so that I might practice implementing specifications based on concepts and high level details, rather than simply copying the existing work in C++.

I am following lessons given in github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer.
